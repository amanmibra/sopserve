# sopserve API

Every endpoint. Paths below are under `/v1/workspaces/<ws>` unless they start with `/v1/`. The OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json` has every field; `/docs` lets you try them.

There is no authentication yet: keep sopserve on a private network.

## Errors

Errors that come from sopc return `422 {"valid": false, "issues": [...]}`. Each issue has sopc's `code`, `message`, `path` and `severity`, plus where it belongs in the forms:

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `agent`, `instruction`, `procedure`, `group` or `settings` |
| `id` | Which one |
| `field` | As the `/config` endpoints name it, e.g. `blocks`, `steps` |
| `index` | Which entry of a list field |
| `text` | The problem in plain words, e.g. "Every agent must include Allergen check; tonys-pizza doesn't." |

A `404` or `409` has `{"detail": "..."}`.

## Config: the forms

What the UI edits. Each item is stored as a sopc file (sopserve writes it, then reads it back with `sopc export` to check it holds exactly what was sent), so git publishing and exports keep working. Saves are drafts: nothing reaches agents until a release. Ids can't be renamed yet.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET …/config` | Every item at head: `{settings, agents, instructions, procedures, groups}`, each with its `version`. Instructions, procedures and groups have `used_by: [{agent, via}]` (`via`: the group the agent lists it through, or null). `422` with `old_format` issues if the workspace is in the sopc v0.0.8 format. |
| `GET/POST …/config/agents` | List agents; create one: `{id, platform, platform_id, context, blocks, variables, author?, note?}` (`409` if it exists). |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE …/config/agents/<id>` | One agent; create or replace it; delete it. |
| `POST …/config/agents/<id>/blocks` | `{block, author?, note?}`: add a shared instruction, procedure or group at the end of the agent's blocks. `409` if the agent already lists it or gets it through a group. |
| `DELETE …/config/agents/<id>/blocks/<block>` | Take a block out of the agent's blocks. `409` if the agent gets it through a group; `422` if it's locked. |
| `POST …/config/agents/<id>/preview` | The agent's fields, unsaved: `{valid, issues, prompt, hash, blocks, release, released_prompt}`. Compiles with the rest of head; saves nothing. |
| `…/config/instructions[/<id>]` | Shared instructions: `{id, text, locked}`. Deleting one takes it out of every agent and group that lists it. |
| `…/config/procedures[/<id>]` | Procedures (SOPs): `{id, name, goal, when, guidance, steps: [{text, tool, required}], never, warning_signs, delivery: prompt\|auto\|tool, locked}`. New ones are written as Markdown; one that came from git keeps its format unless Markdown can't hold an edit, then it becomes YAML. Deleting one takes it out of every agent and group. |
| `…/config/groups[/<id>]` | Groups, kept in `sopc.yaml`: `{id, blocks}`. Deleting one lists its blocks in its place wherever it was used, so no prompt changes. |
| `GET/PUT …/config/settings` | `{variables, procedures_heading}`. |
| `GET …/config/<kind>/<id>/history` | Every version, newest first. Groups and settings list only the versions of `sopc.yaml` that changed them. |
| `GET …/config/<kind>/<id>/versions/<n>` | An older version, as fields. One saved in the old format comes back with `legacy: true` and its `content`. |

Instructions, procedures and groups share one set of names. A locked block must be in every agent, directly or through a group.

## Files

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/workspaces` | Workspaces and their current release. |
| `GET …/files` | Head: every file with its version. `?content=true` includes content (export to git). |
| `POST …/files` | `{changes: {path: content \| null}, author?, note?}`: edit or delete files atomically. Rejected if the result doesn't compile. |
| `PUT …/files` | `{files, author?, note?}`: replace head; files not listed are deleted. |
| `GET …/files/<path>?version=N` | A file at head or at a version. |
| `GET …/history/<path>` | Every version of a file. |

Paths under `build/` in uploads are ignored; absolute paths and `..` are rejected.

## Releases

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET …/draft` | Unpublished changes: files and `items` changed since the current release (each with its fields `before` and `after`), and agents added, changed, removed or unchanged, with the draft and released prompts. A release in the old format is compared as `sopc migrate` converts it. |
| `POST …/releases` | `{author?, note?}`: release head and serve it (returns the current release if nothing changed). |
| `GET …/releases`, `GET …/releases/<n>` | Release history; one release with every agent's prompt. |
| `POST …/releases/<n>/activate` | Serve an older release (roll back). |
| `POST …/publish` | `{files, author?, note?}`: replace + release in one call, for CI. |
| `POST …/migrate` | `{apply?, author?, note?}`: convert a workspace stored in the sopc v0.0.8 format with `sopc migrate`. Returns `{needed, plan, applied, changed}`; with `apply`, the converted files are written as a draft. |

## Serving

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET …/agents` | Agents in the current release (`?release=N` for another). |
| `GET …/agents/<agent>` | **Call start.** `{agent, platform_ref, release, hash, prompt, tools, tool_sops, components}`. `?release=N` pins a release (A/B). Logs a fetch. |
| `GET …/agents/<agent>/prompt` | Just the prompt as text, with `X-Sopc-Release` and `X-Sopc-Hash`. Logs a fetch. |
| `GET …/agents/<agent>/sops/<id>` | What a `get_sop` tool returns, for SOPs with `delivery: auto` or `tool`. |
| `GET …/fetches?agent=` | Which release and prompt hash each agent was served, newest first. |

`<agent>` is the sopc agent id (`tonys-pizza`) or its platform ref (`livekit:tonys-pizza`). `components` lists each file the prompt was built from, in prompt order, at its version: `agent`, `instruction`, `sop`, plus `sopc.yaml` as `config` (`base` in releases made before sopc v0.0.9).

## Stateless

Nothing is stored.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/validate`, `/v1/render`, `/v1/lint` | `{files}`: sopc's checks, compiled prompts, and duplicate or conflicting instructions. |
| `POST /v1/migrate` | `{files}`: a folder in the sopc v0.0.8 format, converted with `sopc migrate`. Returns `{migrated, plan, files}`. |
